<h1 id="The-Bias-Variance-Tradeoff">The Bias-Variance Tradeoff<a class="anchor-link" href="#The-Bias-Variance-Tradeoff"> </a></h1><p>Sometimes, we choose a model that is too simple to represent the underlying
data generation process. Other times, we choose a model that is too complexâ€”it
fits the noise in the data rather than the data's overall pattern.</p>
<p>To understand why this happens, we analyze our models using the tools of
probability and statistics. These tools allow us to generalize beyond a few
isolated examples to describe fundamental phenomena in modeling. In
particular, we will use the tools of expectation and variance to uncover the bias-variance tradeoff.</p>
